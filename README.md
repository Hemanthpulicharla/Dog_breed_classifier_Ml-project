Dog breed classifier using CNN in ML
Welcome to the Dog Breed Classification repository!

This repository contains a machine learning project that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning techniques to classify dog breeds. The project is implemented in Python using the popular deep learning library, Keras.

The project is divided into two parts: training and testing. In the training phase, the model is trained on a large dataset of dog images, which are pre-labeled with their respective breeds. The model uses a CNN architecture and transfer learning to learn the features of the different dog breeds.

In the testing phase, the model is used to classify the breed of new, unseen dog images. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

We hope that this repository will be useful for those interested in using CNNs and transfer learning for dog breed classification, as well as for those looking to learn more about these techniques in general. Thank you for visiting!
